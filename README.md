First repository - Learn how to use Github

After 10 years as sysadmin, out of systems development, I'm coming back to learn new technologies and polish the old ones. Although I previously worked with Git I had never submitted to GitHub. Previous knowledge in Pascal, C, C++, COBOL, CA-CLIPPER, NATURAL/ADABAS, Delphi, VB, Javascript, HTML, ASP, Oracle DB, Java (Struts, Hibernate, Spring), Ruby(Ruby on Rails). New projects in Flutter for now.
